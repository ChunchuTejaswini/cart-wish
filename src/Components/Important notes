in order to imporve the application performance we use some of the react hooks they are
usememo and usecallback 
for code management usereducer hook

Usememo:
usememo is a hook whihc is used for improving the performance if we have expensive calculations in react app

expensive means same as finding the factorial ,finding the fibonacci series ,sum of 1million product price -usememo reduces unwnated calculation and avoids unnecessary renders

usecallback:
used for improving the performance of react application and prevent unwanted re-renders

the only difference is usememo returns a value and usecallback returns a function

usereducer hook is used to organise complex xstate and its method and makes compoennt code more celan


ex: useReducer(reducer,0)

reducer is for handling all functions like for suppose take a counter function in that increase,decrease and reset and second is the 

const [count,dispatch]=useReducer(reducer,0)  //here count is the state    and dispatch function to send something


reducer hook example (count inc,dec,reset)

const reducer=(state,action)=>{
    switch(action.type){
        case "INCREASE":
        return state+1;

        case "Decrease":
        return state-1;

         case "Reset":
        return 0

        default: state;
    }
}
const App=()=>{
    const[count,setcount]=useReducer(reducer,0)

    const inccount=()=>{
        dispatch({type:"INCREASE"})
    }
    const deccount=()=>{
        dispatch({type:"Decrease"})
    }
    const  rescount=()=>{
        dispatch({type:"reset"})
    }
}

cache is  a store which can hold the fetched data in the memory
it acts like a temporary stoorage for our data whihc retunred from API requests

React query features
caching our data
request cancellation on component unmount
multiple retries
